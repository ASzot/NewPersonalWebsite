title: Keeping Track of RL Environments
date: 2020-02-12

More environments to test reinforcement learning (RL) agents are created all
the time. 
As specific problems in RL are tackled, the rate these environments being
made seems to be growing.
To keep track of everything for myself,
and to maybe help others, I compiled a list of RL environments. I decided to
host this list on GitHub so others can easily access it. [Here is the
link](https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs).

If you have a specific project idea, this list can be helpful to find the right
environment to experiment in.  For instance, if you are working on multi-task
learning in RL, you can find some environments to test your method or spark
ideas under the [multi-task learning
section](https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs#multi-task-learning). Even
if you aren't working on a specific project, going through this list and seeing
the challenges each environment presents could inspire new ideas.
