<p>
  More environments to test reinforcement learning (RL) agents are created all
  the time. 
  As specific problems in RL are tackled, the rate these environments being
  made seems to be growing.
  To keep track of everything for myself,
  and to maybe help others, I compiled a list of RL environments. I decided to
  host this list on GitHub so others can easily access it. Here is the
  link:

</p>

<p>
  If you have a specific project idea, this list can be helpful to find
  the right environment to experiment in. 
  For instance, if
  you are working on multi-task learning in RL, you can find some environments to
  test your method or spark ideas under the <a
  href='https://github.com/clvrai/awesome-rl-envs#multi-task-learning'>multi-task
  learning section</a>.  Even if you aren't working on a specific project, going
  through this list and seeing the challenges each environment presents could
  inspire new ideas.
